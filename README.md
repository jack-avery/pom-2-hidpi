# POM-2 HiDPI theme

Based off of the POM-2 computer from Warframe 1999.
This includes only the window decorations (i.e., title bar and buttons).

## How do I use this?

1. Have KDE Plasma installed
2. Clone sources: `git clone https://github.com/jack-avery/pom-2-hidpi`
3. Copy the contents of this folder to `~/.local/share/aurorae/themes/pom-2-hidpi`
4. Set your Window Decoration settings in KDE Plasma

I learned a lot from [this Windows Classic theme](https://github.com/pixelocdguy/windows-classic).
